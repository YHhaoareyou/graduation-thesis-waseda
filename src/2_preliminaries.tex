\section{Pandemic's impact}

Google has been collecting their users' mobility data since the beginning of 2020 \cite{googlemobilityreports} \cite{ourworldindata_2020}.
Results indicate that people do access public places, including transit stations, workplaces and parks, less than before pandemic started spreading.
The pandemic also accelerate the process of digitalization \cite{amankwah-amoah_khan_wood_knight_2021}, which also resulted in a decrease of people commute physically.
There are also investigations indicating that more than tens of thousands of store closed in Japan during the pandemic.
Other investigations show that remote working has becoming a permanent phenomenon around the world \cite{saad_wigert_2021}.
In Japan, government even made a policy to discourage employees to commute physically.
The above situations resulted in more unused facilities left on the society.
The U.S. government holds about 45,000 underused or underutilized buildings according to an investigation by Harvard Business Review \cite{hounsell_2020}.

\section{Local Revitalization}
Local Revitalization is proposed by Japanese government, aiming at combining local unique features or specialties and new ideas or technology,
in order to stimulate rural economics to balance the gap between cities and rural areas \cite{sawaji_2019}.

Common approaches include improving quality or design of existing local products with new techniques, launching new industries with local features, and broadening promotion on SNS or other media.
Of course, a standard does not exist in the field of Local Revitalization, and there are different cases adopting diverse approaches,
such as inserting real landscapes or local products into dramas or animations to attract audience,
or inviting artists to create graffiti at shopping streets to get their customers back \cite{中野経済新聞_2015}\cite{サンテレビニュース_2021}\cite{urbact_2019}.

As the development of Augmented Reality, there are also cases implementing Augmented Reality in their revitalization projects,
such as placing a virtual castle on a historical ruin \cite{井上道哉_長澤可也_2021} and displaying interactive digital contents beside local physical exhibits \cite{センチメンタル価値再生_2016}\cite{armarker_and_behavior_log_2011}.

\section{Location-based Augmented Reality}
Augmented Reality (AR) utilizes camera on smartphone or glasses to capture the landscape of real world,
and then displays digital contents on the captured landscape so as to combine digital information with reality.
Location-based Augemnted Reality makes use of geographical information such as GPS data or feature points of a landscape,
so that displayed contents are located corresponding to a specific location.
Pokémon Go is one of the famous cases of Location-based AR, which displays virtual characters 'pokemons' based on geographic coordinates around the world and requires players to move physically to catch them \cite{pokemongo_homepage}.
The game has earned more than 5 billion dollars since its launch 5 years ago \cite{strategist_2021}, indicating the enormous popularity it possesses.

Beside entertainment, Location-based AR is also applied in tourism and education cases,
including displaying educational resources on a tablet when getting close to a spot in an archaeological site \cite{law_2018},
or asking a user to challenge a quiz on one's smartphone when approaching a historical building \cite{hwang_chang_chen_chen_2017}.

\section{Co-creation}
Co-creation, in business context, is defined as a company involving its customers in the creation of products or services to suit customers' own context \cite{cocreation_definition}.
In a general context, it is also defined as any act of creativity that is shared by two or more people \cite{cocreation_definition_general}.
Co-creation can happen not merely between a company and its customers but also in occasions where value creation is conducted by ordinary people together \cite{cocreation_general_case}.

Furthermore, cases of co-creation with Augmented Reality implemented also emerged in recent years.
Anttoni Lehto et al. presents an adoption of co-creation which allowed students to initially create contents for a location-based AR learning platform \cite{lehto_lautkankare_brander_ala-nissila_saari_salminen_2020}.
Jorge Bacca et al. proposes a framework to utilize co-creation in designing motivational augmented reality for vocational education and training \cite{acosta_navarro_gesa_kinshuk_2019}.
